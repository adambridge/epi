Inserts, lookups, and deletes are O(1). Keys are stored (optionally with values) in an array at
locations dictated by hash function. Distributed evenly for well chosen hash function.
Commonly use linked list at collisions. Assuming hashing is O(1), lookup/insert/delete are actually
O(1 + n/m) for n keys in array of size m. Can be rehashed O(n + m) when overloaded.
Keys ideally immutable or have to move values when cheanged.
