full/perfect/complete binary tree.
full: every node has two children
perfect: every row is full (apart from bottom whch is all leaf nodes)
complete: every row is full apart from (possibly) the last and all nodes are as far left as possible

traversal:
inorder: left subtree, root, right subtree
preorder: root, left subtree, right subtree
postorder: left subtree, right subtree, root

   a        inorder:    d b e a f c g
 b   c      preorder:   a b d e c f g
d e f g     postorder:  d e b f g c a

Implemented recursively have O(n) time complexity (for n nodes) and O(h) memory complexity (tree of height h, limited by max stack depth)
